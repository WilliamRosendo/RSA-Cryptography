# RSA-Cryptography



\## Project Motivation



This project was created to better understand how the RSA algorithm works in practice.  

Instead of using libraries, everything was implemented manually in C, including prime number checking, key generation, modular exponentiation, encryption, and decryption.



Working at a low level helped us understand the math behind RSA and how text data can be transformed into numbers and back again.  

The goal was not to create a secure or optimized cryptographic system, but to learn how public-key cryptography works step by step.



This project was developed as an academic exercise and as a way to practice both C programming and cryptography fundamentals.
